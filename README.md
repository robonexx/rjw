# Portfolio 2023

Started this project learning next 13 and type script. 
Decided later to use this as my next portfolio. 
I removed typescript from this project. 

## Tech used

- Next 13
- Sass
- Framer motion
- react-spring (i know 2 animation libraries)
- markdown to jsx
- graymatter 
- react-icons (might create my own)

### Theme selector
Got and idea of having a lamp as my theme selector
Used figma to do the SVG, then using framer motion &
react-spring for the animation. 
Morphing the bulp. :D 
Have to work more on the dark light mode

### Data

Using markdown and taking in the "data" from there to create posts
Todo, 
Create and object / array with all text for the page
Fetch repos from github, take the info and link to the repos
Maybe Firebase to connect with a contact form, maybe a comments field.
