New life 2023

So how did I end up here? 
I was on top of my game in the dance world, and suddenly
its like my hole world fell apart. My mind was unfocused,
my body was hurting, my soul was lost.

I dident feel that I got any support in what ive done my hole
life, and no we should not expect to get anything. But sometimes
a thank you could be enough... for us to keep going.

Im finding new ways to be creative, and I still love my teachings,
I love seeing peolple grow and yet I wonder if I could be something
else. Can I become as good in coding as I was in my dancing.

Can I posses the same knowledge in code? I mean dancing is endless too, but after a certain amount of years, You are pretty good at what you do. Or... ok Ive danced all my life, ofcourse I should be good. 

Coding thou its and othe world, there is no time when you get in to it, its like everything dissapears, and you minds starts working double time. You try to find sollutions to everything, wanting to learn everything and understand, but there is just too much, its impossible. Yet I get better everyday and I dream...
